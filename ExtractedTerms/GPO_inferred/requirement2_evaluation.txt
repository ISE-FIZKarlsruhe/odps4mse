For example, joule per kelvin and J/K are respectively the name and symbol of both a measurement unit of heat capacity and a measurement unit of entropy, which are generally not considered to be quantities of the same kind.

However, in some cases special measurement unit names are restricted to be used with quantities of specific kind only.

For example, the measurement unit ‘second to the power minus one’ (1/s) is called hertz (Hz) when used for frequencies and becquerel (Bq) when used for activities of radionuclides.

As another example, the joule (J) is used as a unit of energy, but never as a unit of moment of force, i.e. the newton metre (N · m). — quantities of the same kind have the same quantity dimension,
— quantities of different quantity dimensions are always of different kinds, and
— quantities having the same quantity dimension are not necessarily of the same kind.
ISO 80000-1 Measured or simulated 'physical propertiy'-s are always defined by a physical law, connected to a physical entity through a model perspective and measurement is done according to the same model.

Systems of units suggests that this is the correct approach, since except for the fundamental units (length, time, charge) every other unit is derived by mathematical relations between these fundamental units, implying a physical laws or definitions. In the same system of quantities, dim ρB = ML−3 is the quantity dimension of mass concentration of component B, and ML−3 is also the quantity dimension of mass density, ρ.

ISO 80000-1 While the SI brochure treats 'MeasurementUnit' as a 'PhysicalQuantity', in the EMMO this is not possible since the latter always has two direct parts, a 'Numerical' and a 'MeasurementUnit', while the former a single 'Symbol'.

SI distinguishes between a quantity (an abstract concept) and the quantity value (a number and a reference). The EMMO, following strict nominalism, considers a SI quantity as a SI quantity value, collapsing the two concepts into one: the 'Quantity'.

So, for the EMMO the symbol "kg" is not a physical quantity but a 'MeasurementUnit', while the string "1 kg" is 'Physical Quantity'. "Unit symbols are mathematical entities and not abbreviations."

"Symbols for units are treated as mathematical entities. In expressing the value of a quantity as the product of a numerical value and a unit, both the numerical value and the unit may be treated by the ordinary rules of algebra."

http://emmo.info/emmo#EMMO_802d3e92_8770_4f98_a289_ccaaab7fdddf: ('EMMO' is the disjoint union of 'Item' and 'Collection' (covering axiom).

The union implies that 'EMMO' individuals can only be 'Item' individuals (standing for self-connected world objects) or 'Collection' individuals (standing for a collection of disconnected items).

Disjointness means that a 'Collection' individual cannot be an 'Item' individual and viceversa, representing the fact that a world object cannot be self-connected and non-self connected at the same time. Mereotopology is the logical framework used by the EMMO ontologist to characterize the universe and to provide the definitions to connect world objects to the EMMO concepts.

For the EMMO ontologist the whole universe is the most comprehensive object. World objects are then sub-parts of the universe. 

The fundamental distinction between world objects, upon which the EMMO is based, is self-connectedness: a world object can be self-connected xor not self-connected.

Parthood relations do not change dimensionality of the world object: every part of a world object is another world object and always retains a 4D dimensionality character.

The smallest part of a world object (i.e. a part that has no proper parts) is called a 'Quantum' individual. Quantum individuals are the fundamental causal constituents of the universe. They are no-dimensional, and their aggregation makes 4D objects emerge  from their causal structure.

It follows that, for the EMMO, world objects of dimensionality lower than 4D (e.g. surfaces, lines) do not exist.

In the EMMO there are no relations such as occupiesSpace, since objects are themselves the 4D regions.

An object always possess 4-dimensions. It follows from the fact that perception is always unfolding in time (e.g. you always have an aperture time when you take a picture or measure a property. Instantaneous perceptions are idealizations (abstractions) or a very small time measurement).)

This does not mean that there cannot be a change in the internal structure of the 'State' direct parts. It means only that this change must not affect the existence of the direct part itself.

There is no change in granularity or cardinality of direct parts of a 'State'.

The use of spatial direct parthood in 'State' definition means that a 'State' cannot overlap in space another 'State'. The usefulness of 'State' is that it makes it possible to describe the evolution in time of an 'Existent' in terms of series of 'State'-s that can take into account the disappearance or appearance of parts within a 'Physical'. 

A 'State' is a recognizable granularity level of matter, in the sense that its direct parts do not appear or disappear within its lifetime as it can be for a generic 'Existent'. Direct partitions declaration is a choice of the ontologist that choses the classes to be used as direct parts, according to its own world view.

A 'State' can always be direct partitioned in 'Elementary'-s and 'Void' or 'Physical'.

e.g. the water in my glass can be seen as a single object without declaring direct parts, or as made of H2O molecules direct parts. There is no change in granularity or cardinality of parts within a state.

The use of spatial direct parthood in state definition means that a state cannot overlap in space another state that is direct part of the same whole.)

A number is actually a string (e.g. 1.4, 1e-8) of numerical digits and other symbols. However, in order not to increase complexity of the taxonomy and relations, here we take a number as an "atomic" object, without decomposit it in digits (i.e. we do not include digits in the EMMO as alphabet for numbers). In math usually number and numeral are distinct concepts, the numeral being the symbol or a composition of symbols (e.g. 3.14, 010010, three) and the number is the idea behind it.
More than one numeral stands for the same number.
In the EMMO abstract entities do not exists, and numbers are simply defined by other numerals, so that a number is the class of all the numerals that are equivalent (e.g. 3 and 0011 are numerals that stands for the same number).
Or alternatively, an integer numeral may also stands for a set of a specific cardinality (e.g. 3 stands for a set of three apples). Rational and real numbers are simply a syntactic arrangment of integers (digits, in decimal system).
The fact that you can't give a name to a number without using a numeral or, in case of positive integers, without referring to a real world objects set with specific cardinality, suggests that the abstract concept of number is not a concept that can be practically used.
For these reasons, the EMMO will consider numerals and numbers as the same concept.)

http://emmo.info/emmo#EMMO_9895a1b4_f0a5_4167_ac5e_97db40b8bfcc: (The conventional symbolic representation of the dimension of a base quantity is a single upper case letter in roman (upright) type. The conventional symbolic representation of the dimension of a derived quantity is the product of powers of the dimensions of the base quantities according to the definition of the derived quantity. The dimension of a quantity Q is denoted by dim Q.
ISO 80000-1 All physical quantities, with the exception of counts, are derived quantities, which may be written in terms of base quantities according to the equations of physics. The dimensions of the derived quantities are written as products of powers of the dimensions of the base quantities using the equations that relate the derived quantities to the base quantities.
In general the dimension of any quantity Q is written in the form of a dimensional product,

dim Q = T^α L^β M^γ I^δ Θ^ε N^ζ J^η

where the exponents α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ and η, which are generally small integers, which can be positive, negative, or zero, are called the dimensional exponents.
(SI brochure) The expression used by the EMMO for physical dimensions is a metrological symbol (but a string at meta level, i.e. the ontologist level) like this:

Ta Lb Mc Id Θe Nf Jg

where a, b, c, d, e, f and g are 0 or signed integers.

Regex for the physical dimension symbol for the EMMO is:
^T([+-][1-9]|0) L([+-][1-9]|0) M([+-][1-9]|0) I([+-][1-9]|0) Θ([+-][1-9]|0) N([+-][1-9]|0) J([+-][1-9]|0)$

Examples of correspondance between base units and physical dimensions are:
mol -> T0 L0 M0 I0 Θ0 N+1 J0
s -> T+1 L0 M0 I0 Θ0 N0 J0
A/m2 -> T0 L0 M-2 I+1 Θ0 N0 J0)

'Existent' class collects all individuals that stand for physical objects that can be structured in well defined temporal sub-parts called states, through the temporal direct parthood relation.

This class provides a first granularity hierarchy in time, and a way to axiomatize tessellation principles for a specific whole with a non-transitivity relation (direct parthood) that helps to retain the granularity levels.

e.g. a car, a supersaturated gas with nucleating nanoparticles, an atom that becomes ionized and then recombines with an electron. An 'Existent' individual stands for a real world object for which the ontologist wants to provide univocal tessellation in time.

By definition, the tiles are represented by 'State'-s individual.

Tiles are related to the 'Existent' through temporal direct parthood, enforcing non-transitivity and inverse-functionality. ex-sistere (latin): to stay (to persist through time) outside others of the same type (to be distinct from the rest).

Moreover, time is a measured property in the EMMO and not an objective characteristic of an object, and cannot be used as temporal index to identify endurant position in time.

In fact, the object/process distinction is simply a matter of convenience in a 4D approach since a temporal extension is always the case, and stationarity depends upon observer time scale. For this reason, the same individual (4D object) may play the role of a process or of an object class depending on the object to which it relates.

Nevertheless, it is useful to introduce categorizations that characterize persistency through continuant and occurrent concepts, even if not ontologically but only cognitively defined. This is also due to the fact that our language distinguish between nouns and verbs to address things, forcing the separation between things that happens and things that persist.

This perspective provides classes conceptually similar to the concepts of endurant and perdurant (a.k.a. continuant and occurrent). We claim that this distinction is motivated by our cognitive bias, and we do not commit to the fact that both these kinds of entity “do really exist”. For this reason, a whole instance can be both process and object, according to different cognitive approaches (see Wonderweb D17).

The distinction between endurant and perdurant as usually introduced in literature (see BFO SPAN/SNAP approach) is then no more ontological, but can still be expressed through the introduction of ad hoc primitive definitions that follow the interpreter endurantist or perdurantist attitude.)

Examples of physical properties include density, index of refraction, magnetization and chemical composition. A simple description is that a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform, physically distinct, and (often) mechanically separable. In a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar, the ice cubes are one phase, the water is a second phase, and the humid air is a third phase over the ice and water. The glass of the jar is another separate phase.

The term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but there can be several immiscible phases of the same state of matter. Also, the term phase is sometimes used to refer to a set of equilibrium states demarcated in terms of state variables such as pressure and temperature by a phase boundary on a phase diagram. Because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter, such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another, this latter usage is similar to the use of "phase" as a synonym for state of matter. However, the state of matter and phase diagram usages are not commensurate with the formal definition given above and the intended meaning must be determined in part from the context in which the term is used.)

http://emmo.info/emmo#EMMO_90ae56e4_d197_49b6_be1a_0049e4756606: (A continuant (here called object) is usually defined as a whole whose all possible temporal parts are always satisfying a specific criterion (wich is the classical definition of continuants).

However that's not possible in general, since we will finally end to temporal parts whose temporal extension is so small that the connectivity relations that define the object will no longer hold. That's the case when the temporal interval is lower than the interval that characterize the causality interactions between the object parts.

In other terms, if the time span of a temporal part is lower than the inverse of the frequency of interactions between the constituents, then the constituents in such temporal part are not connected. The object is no more an object, neither an item, but simply a collection of fundamental parts.

To overcome this issue, we can identify an minimum holistic temporal part (a lower time interval value), below which a specific definition for an object type does not hold anymore, that is called a fundamental.)

This can be used in material characterization, to define exactly the type of measurement done, including the instrument type. A conventional referring to an object according to a specific code that reflects the results of a specific interaction mechanism and is shared between other interpreters.
A coded is always a partial representation of an object since it reflects the object capability to be part of a specific determination.
A coded is a sort of name or label that we put upon objects that interact with an determiner in the same specific way.

For example, "hot" objects are objects that interact with an observer through a perception mechanism aimed to perceive an heat source. The code is made of terms such as "hot", "warm", "cold", that commonly refer to the perception of heat.)
