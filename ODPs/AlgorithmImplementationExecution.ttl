There is an ML Task :task29 which is a supervised classification task defined on the dataset :credit-a.
This task is achieved by the Execution :run100241 which executes the Implementation :wekaLogistic of the Algorithm :logisticRegression which
this execution realizes.
The Implementation :wekaLogistic has five hyperparameters (Parameter): :wekaLogisticC, :wekaLogisticDoNotCheckCapabilities, :wekaLogisticM, :wekaLogisticOutputDebugInfo, :wekaLogisticR. The values of two of these hyperparameters are set. The hyperparameter :wekaLogisticM has value set to -1 (expressed via the ParameterSetting :wekaLogisticMSetting29), and the hyperparameter :wekaLogisticR that has its value set to \"1.0E-8\"^^xsd:float (expressed via the ParameterSetting :wekaLogisticRSetting29).
