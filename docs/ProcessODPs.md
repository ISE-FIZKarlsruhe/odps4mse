Here is the list of Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) aligned with process modeling requirements in the Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) domain.

It aligns with the three core requirements identified in the paper:

1. **Requirement 1: Process Structure** — Model processes, sub-processes, steps, and execution order.  
2. **Requirement 2: Data & Resources** — Capture inputs, outputs, and parameters per step (e.g., temperature, pressure, atmosphere, instruments, calibration).  
3. **Requirement 3: Project & Roles** — Represent project goals, stages, agents, and their roles (e.g., synthesis, microscopy, simulation).
