Behavioral Material Property	PMD_0000005	Class	https://w3id.org/pmd/co/PMD_0000005			"Technical materials are complex object aggregates. The properties that are determined for those object aggregates are intrinsically associated with the methodologies employed in the measurement process. This is in contrast to typical 'physical' properties, which like e.g. mass that can be determined to high accuracy independently of the measurement process. 
As a consequence, the behavoiral material properties in the ontology are differeciated according to their measurement method, e.g. Brinell hardness and Vickers hardness are different types of indentation hardness rather than different measures/quantification (GDC) of the materials property 'indentation hardness'.
 The 'unit idenifieres' of such properties (e.g. ""HV1"", ""HV10"", ""HBW"") are strictly speaking not units but rather references to the measurement methodology used to determine a numeric value that quantifies the property."
