Quantum	EMMO_3f9ae00e_810c_4518_aec2_7200e424cf68	Class	http://emmo.info/emmo#EMMO_3f9ae00e_810c_4518_aec2_7200e424cf68			"A 'Quantum' is the most fundamental subclass of 'Item', since its individuals stand for the simplest possible world objects, and are considered self-connected by definition.

The quantum concept recalls the fact that there is lower epistemological limit to our knowledge of the universe, related to the uncertainity principle.

Space and time emerge following the network of causal connections between quantum objects. So quantum objects are adimensional objects, that precede space and time dimensions.

A quantum is the EMMO mereological atomistic entity. 

To avoid confusion with the concept of atom coming from physics, we will use the expression quantum mereology, instead of atomistic mereology."

Participation is not under direct parthood since a process is not strictly related to reductionism, but it's a way to categorize temporal regions by the interpreters."
Object	EMMO_90ae56e4_d197_49b6_be1a_0049e4756606	Class	http://emmo.info/emmo#EMMO_90ae56e4_d197_49b6_be1a_0049e4756606	Continuant | Endurant		"A continuant (here called object) is usually defined as a whole whose all possible temporal parts are always satisfying a specific criterion (wich is the classical definition of continuants).

However that's not possible in general, since we will finally end to temporal parts whose temporal extension is so small that the connectivity relations that define the object will no longer hold. That's the case when the temporal interval is lower than the interval that characterize the causality interactions between the object parts.

In other terms, if the time span of a temporal part is lower than the inverse of the frequency of interactions between the constituents, then the constituents in such temporal part are not connected. The object is no more an object, neither an item, but simply a collection of fundamental parts.

To overcome this issue, we can identify an minimum holistic temporal part (a lower time interval value), below which a specific definition for an object type does not hold anymore, that is called a fundamental."

In the EMMO, topological connectivity is based on causality.

All physical systems, i.e. systems whose behaviour is explained by physics laws, are represented only by 'Item'-s.

Members of a 'Collection' lack of causality connection, i.e. they do not constitute a physical system as a whole."

A 'Sign' usually havs 'sign' spatial direct parts only up to a certain elementary semiotic level, in which the part is only a 'Physical' and no more a 'Sign' (i.e. it stands for nothing). This elementary semiotic level is peculiar to each particular system of signs (e.g. text, painting).

Just like an 'Elementary' in the 'Physical' branch, each 'Sign' branch should have an a-tomistic mereological part."
